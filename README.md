# BBCA analysis project

## Presentation
The BBCA New Building Standard, first published in 2016, is the first method for measuring the carbon footprint of new buildings throughout their life cycle (construction, operation, and end-of-life). Its goal is to highlight exemplary low-carbon buildings and promote best practices in reducing carbon emissions.  
> **WARNING**: Note : I made this project back in 2022, so the data are not up-to-date.

## Goal of the study
In this study, we will use a dump of the BBCA building database to analyze the effects of the BBCA standard on new buildings :
- Quantification of carbon impacts, differences between public/private housing and public/private commercial buildings.
- Confirmation of the differences between residential and commercial buildings, exploration of potential differences within residential buildings or within commercial buildings.
- Is it possible to construct buildings that are energy-efficient in use and have low carbon emissions throughout their life cycle ?
- Address the study's objectives while critically assessing the quality of the data and uncertainties. Expand on environmental impacts beyond carbon.

## Dataset
**58 New buildings adopting the E+C- approach, including :**
- 10 Private multi-family housing
- 13 Public multi-family housing
- 9 Private commercial buildings
- 26 Public commercial buildings

**7 quantitative variables on which the analysis is based :**
- Net primary energy consumption (1) in kWhep/m².year
- Construction cost in €
- Floor area in m²
- 4 E+C- contributors in kgCO2eq/m² :
  - Water + energy consumption contributor during the construction phase
  - Construction products and equipment contributor
  - Water consumption contributor during the operational phase
  - Energy consumption contributor during the operational phase

**2 qualitative variables :**
- Building type
- Climate zone
